__Kinetics__

Author: Rajka Pejanovic

**Kinetics
is a Python-based tool for analyzing absorbance data from molecular binding experiments. It supports both **two-species** and **three-species** sequential binding models.

You do **not** need to be a programmer to use this tool — just follow the steps below!

## 💡 What It Does

Kinetics takes an Excel file containing your experimental absorbance data and fits it using physical models. It:

- ✅ Calculates best-fit dissociation constants (K₁, K₂, and K₃)
- ✅ Predicts ΔAbs values
- ✅ Use calculated k values to calculate the concentrations (of free ligand, A1B, A2B..)
- ✅ Plots fit curves and calculated concentrations
- ✅ Saves all results into a `.csv` file and prints the fitting results.

## 📦 Installation

1.💡 Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kinetics.git
cd kinetics

2.🧑‍💻 (Optional/Recomended) Create a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

💎 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

	### OR use conda:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate kinetics-env

### Data Format
Prepare an Excel file (e.g. data.xlsx) with three columns:

B (HSA)	A (ICG)	m (ΔAbs)
0.00001	0.00001	0.12
0.00005	0.00001	0.20
...	...	...
B: protein concentration (varied)

A: ligand concentration (typically constant)

m: measured absorbance change

Place your file in the data/ directory.


🏃‍♂️ How to Run
## From the root of the repo:

To run the two-species model:
python3 run.py 2species --file data/data.xlsx

To run the three-species model:
python3 run.py 3species --file data/data.xlsx


📄 Output
You will get:

📈 Plots:

Measured vs Fitted ΔAbs

Residuals

Fraction Bound vs Protein

Species Concentrations vs Protein

📄 A .csv file in the results/ folder with:

Measured and fitted absorbance

Calculated concentrations of bound and free species

Fraction bound

Results saved to 'results/three_species_fit.csv'



🧠Configuration
Change default output path:
Edit the save_path argument in the summarize_results() call in run.py.

Change parameter bounds or guesses:
Modify the Parameters() setup inside:

fit_2step_deltaAbs() for the 2-species model

fit_3species_deltaAbs() for the 3-species model

## You can also reparameterize by using logarithmic space (e.g. log_K1 instead of K1) for more stable fitting.
